      <p><b>Allergies</b></p>
      <p>Many people in the Bahrain suffer from seasonal itchy, swollen, red eyes. Airborne allergens, such as house dust, animal dander and mold constantly bombard the eyes and can cause ocular allergies at any time. But when spring rolls around and the plant pollen starts flying, it seems like everyone starts crying. Seasonal allergic conjunctivitis, or hay fever, is the most common allergic eye problem. Various antihistamine and decongestant drops and sprays can soothe irritated eyes and nose. Make every effort to avoid allergens. An allergist can help determine what you are allergic to so you can stay away from it. Staying away from outdoor pollen may be impossible, but remaining indoors in the morning when the outdoor pollen levels are highest may help control symptoms. If you are allergic to house dust, open windows and keep household filters clean.    <a href="">..more&raquo;</a></p>

      <p><b>Contact Lens</b></p>
      <p> Over 24 million people choose contact lenses to correct vision. When used with care and proper supervision, contacts are a safe and effective alternative to eyeglasses. And with today's new lens technology, many people who wear eyeglasses can also successfully wear contacts. Contacts are thin, clear discs that float on the tear film that coats the cornea, the curved front surface of the eye. Contacts correct the same refractive conditions eyeglasses correct: myopia (nearsightedness), hyperopia (farsightedness) and astigmatism (an oval- rather than round-shaped cornea). <a href="">..more&raquo;</a></p>

      <p><b>Cosmetics</b></p>
      <p> Contact lens wearers who wear cosmetics on a daily basis may be especially vulnerable to eye problems. Misuse of products and adverse reactions to ingredients used in cosmetic formulas cause lens deposits, eye irritation, allergy, dryness, injury and infection. Knowing which products to use and how to use them is important for long-term, problem-free contact lens wear.Before handling lenses, wash your hands with a mild soap such as Neutrogena, Ivory or a clear glycerin soap. Or, use one of the specialty soaps for contact lens wearers such as AOSoap or Optisoap. Avoid soaps containing cream, deodorant, antiseptics, or heavy fragrances. <a href="">..more&raquo;</a></p>

      <p> <strong>Eye Glasses</strong> </p>
      <p> Sixty percent of the 161 million Americans who wear prescription eyewear choose eyeglasses. Wearing eyeglasses is one of the simplest ways to correct vision problems. To see images clearly, light rays must focus directly on the retina, the light-sensitive nerve layer that lines the back of the eye. There are different kinds of focusing problems, called refractive errors, which may require corrective lenses. In the case of myopia or nearsightedness, the eye is too long. Light rays focus before reaching the retina and images appear blurry. In hyperopia or farsightedness, the eye is too short, so light rays have not yet focused when they reach the retina. Astigmatism describes an eye with a cornea that is oval shaped instead of round, causing light rays to hit the retina in more than one place <a href="">..more&raquo;</a></p>

      <p> <strong>Eye Safety</strong> </p>
      <p> Accidents resulting in serious eye injuries can happen to anyone, but are particularly common in children and young adults. More than 90% of all eye injuries can be prevented with appropriate supervision and protective eyewear. Goggles and face protection can prevent injuries in sports like baseball, basketball, racket sports, and hockey. It is more difficult to protect against injuries in boxing, though thumbless gloves help.People who must rely on only one good eye should wear polycarbonate safety glasses all the time and should wear safety goggles for sports and other dangerous activities. Choose frames and lenses that meet the American National Standards Institute standard for safety (Z87.1). <a href="">..more&raquo;</a></p>

        <p>The most common type of eye injury that needs immediate action is a chemical burn. Alkaline materials (lye, plasters, cements, and ammonia), solvents, acids, and detergents can be harmful to the eye. Eyes should be flushed liberally with water if exposed to any of these agents.<a href="">..more&raquo;</a></p>

            People who lose vision in one eye because of an injury or a medical condition must adapt to a narrower field of vision and loss of depth perception. They still see small objects as well as before, assuming the other eye is normal.<a href="">..more&raquo;</a>

        <p>
            Any activity where something is flying at the eye puts the eye at risk for an injury. Over one million people suffer eye injuries each year in the United States. Almost 50% of these accidents occur at home and over 90% of them could have been prevented.</p>
<p>Minor injuries to the cornea-the clear, protective covering over the front of the eye-can be quite painful. A corneal abrasion is a scratch. Appropriate treatment may include an antibiotic drop or ointment and an eye patch for comfort. Sand or other particles can stick to the cornea. Such foreign bodies may be removed with a moistened Q-tip, usually by a doctor. Do not rub the eye.<a href="">..more&raquo;</a>
