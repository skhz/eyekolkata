Phaco operation can be done at any stage of cataract. You can undergo phaco operation whenever it starts hampering your day to day activities.

In phaco surgery, it is better to get operated at early stage of cataract, because at this stage the cataract is soft and it emulsifies very easily with little ultra sonic energy, which is beneficial for your eyes.
